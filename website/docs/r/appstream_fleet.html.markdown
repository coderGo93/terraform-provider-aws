    desired_instances = 1
  }
  description                    = "test fleet"
  idle_disconnect_timeout_in_seconds             = 15
  display_name                   = "test-fleet"
  enable_default_internet_access = false
  fleet_type                     = "ON_DEMAND"
  image_name                     = "Amazon-AppStream2-Sample-Image-02-04-2019"
  instance_type                  = "stream.standard.large"
  max_user_duration_in_seconds              = 600
  vpc_config {
    subnet_ids                     = ["subnet-06e9b13400c225127"]
